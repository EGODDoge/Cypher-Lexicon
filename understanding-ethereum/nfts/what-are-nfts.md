# What are NFT's

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are not interchangeable. Each NFT represents a unique item with its own digital identity that can be verified on a blockchain. NFTs can be used to represent a wide range of items, including digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and even real-world assets.

NFTs are stored on a blockchain, which is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record-keeping. The most well-known blockchain is the Ethereum blockchain, which is often used for creating and managing NFTs. Other popular blockchains for NFTs include Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche.

When an NFT is sold, the buyer receives a digital token that represents ownership of the item. The NFT can be stored in a digital wallet, just like any other cryptocurrency. NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded on digital marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, and Universe.xyz.

The use of NFTs is still in its early stages, but there is a growing community of artists, collectors, gamers, and others who are exploring the potential of this new technology.
