# ‚õè Mining Vs Staking ETH

## Mining

Mining is the process of verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and earning rewards for doing so. This is done by running special mining software on your computer which competes with other miners to be the first to verify a block of transactions. If you are the first to verify a block, you are rewarded with a certain amount of ETH.

## Staking

Staking is a form of validating transactions just like a miner, instead of proof-of-work it is called proof-of-stake. Using this consensus mechanism Blockchains can support themselves without the need to use a large amount of power on miners. Proof-of-Stake often has a lower entry barrier as users don't need to pay for the latest hardware. Creating a network with stronger immunity to centralization. Users are required to "stake" to create a node on a network to become a validator.

### Network Security PoS

Just like PoW PoS is susceptible to 51% of attacks, although it is a lot riskier for an attacker. They would be required to hold 51% of the validators, which could be extremely expensive, as well as the value of the currency itself would fall.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a proof of work chain but from its origin, it has planned to switch over to proof-of-stake. To become a validator you would need to stake 32ETH on layer 2. There are also options for people who don't hold enough eth, as they can join a pool with other users to earn rewards together based on their stake amount. Changing to PoS also allows for sharding, which can split the network into 64 different chains reducing network congestion.
