# ðŸ“” What are Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met, allowing two counterparties to set these conditions for a transaction without needing to trust a Bank or other third parties. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without an intermediary's involvement or time loss.

On Ethereum Smart contracts are permissionless meaning anyone can write/deploy a smart contract. To write contracts o Ethereum you will need some knowledge of one of its programming languages, the most popular being Solidity. Since deploying a contract is a transaction "Gas Fees" are required to pay, meaning the deployer will need enough Ether in their wallet to deploy. The Gas cost for deploying a contract is far higher than a normal ETH transfer.

It is highly recommended to test your contract on the test net before deploying it to the main net.

Below is a list of Coins/Tokens that can run smart contracts, and the corresponding programming language used. These are not all the coins that can utilize smart contracts.
