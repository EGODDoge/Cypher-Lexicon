# â„¹ Contract spend limits

There is no definitive answer to this question as it largely depends on the specific cryptocurrency and smart contract platform being used. Generally speaking, however, most crypto contracts will have some kind of limit in place in order to prevent accidental or malicious spends.&#x20;

For example, the popular Ethereum blockchain has a gas limit which caps the amount of computational resources that can be used in a single transaction. This limit helps to ensure that the Ethereum network does not get bogged down by excessively large or complex transactions. Similarly, many cryptocurrencies have a maximum transaction size which helps to keep the blockchain manageable and prevents malicious actors from flooding the network with small transactions.
