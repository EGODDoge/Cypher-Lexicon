# Support Scams

Support scams are generally perpetrated by criminals who contact victims posing as technical support representatives for well-known companies. These scammers often use high-pressure tactics to convince victims to provide them with personal information or money. In some cases, support scammers may also install malicious software on victims' computers.

Support scams are a type of fraud and can be very costly for victims. If you receive a suspicious call or email from someone claiming to be from a technical support team, do not respond and instead report the incident to the authorities.

Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet, which is still in development. It promises to be more decentralized, open, and secure than the current web. While support scams are not specifically tied to Web 3.0, it is possible that scammers may attempt to take advantage of the hype surrounding the new technology to perpetrate their crimes.
