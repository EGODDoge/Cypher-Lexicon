# "ETH2" Token Scam

The most common type of scam involving ETH2 tokens is the so-called "Ponzi scheme". In a Ponzi scheme, participants are promised high returns for investing in the scheme, but instead of investing the money, the organizers simply pay out returns to early investors with money from new investors. This type of scam is often used to defraud people of large sums of money, and can be difficult to spot.&#x20;

Another common scam involving ETH2 tokens is the "pump and dump" scheme. In this type of scam, investors are lured in by promises of quick and easy profits, but the price of the tokens is artificially inflated through false or misleading information. Once the price reaches a certain level, the organizers sell their tokens for a profit, and the price quickly plummets, leaving investors with worthless tokens.&#x20;

Finally, there is also the risk that ETH2 tokens could be counterfeit. This could happen if someone creates a new token that looks identical to an existing ETH2 token, but is actually worth less. This type of scam could be difficult to spot, so it is important to be careful when buying ETH2 tokens.
