# Phishing Scams

Phishing is a type of online scam where criminals pose as a legitimate organization or person in order to trick you into giving them sensitive information, such as your passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. They may do this by sending you an email that looks like it’s from a legitimate organization, or by setting up a fake website that looks like a legitimate website.

Criminals can use the information you provide to commit identity theft or financial fraud. They may also use it to gain access to your email account or social media account, where they can then send out phishing emails or messages to your contacts.

If you receive an email or message that looks like it’s from a legitimate organization or person, but you’re not sure, don’t respond to it. Don’t click on any links or open any attachments. If you’re not sure if a website is legitimate, don’t enter any information on it.

If you think you may have fallen for a phishing scam, contact the organization that the email or message claimed to be from and let them know. You should also change your passwords and monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity.
