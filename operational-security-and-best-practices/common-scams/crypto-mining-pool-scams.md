# Crypto Mining Pool Scams

Crypto mining pool scams are when a group of miners team up to pool their resources and mine a cryptocurrency together, but then keep the rewards for themselves instead of sharing them with the other miners. This can be done by setting up a false mining pool, or by manipulating the pool's software to give the miners a false sense of progress.

The false mining pool is the more common of the two scams. This is where a group of miners create a mining pool, but then don't actually share the rewards with the other miners. They may keep the rewards for themselves, or they may distribute the rewards among themselves in an uneven way. This can be done by setting up a mining pool that has high fees, or by not sharing information about the pool's performance with the other miners.

The second type of scam is where a group of miners manipulate the pool's software to give the miners a false sense of progress. This can be done by setting the pool's software to show a higher level of difficulty than what is actually being mined, or by showing a lower hash rate than what the pool is actually achieving. This can be done to make it look like the pool is doing better than it actually is, or to make it look like the pool is not progressing as fast as it actually is.
