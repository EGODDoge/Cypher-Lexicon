# Common Scams

One of the most common scams is malware. Malware is software that is designed to damage or disable your computer. It can be installed on your computer without your knowledge, and can be used to steal your personal information or to take control of your computer.

There is the risk of identity theft. This is when someone takes your personal information, such as your name, Social Security number, or credit card number, and uses it to open new accounts, make purchases, or take out loans in your name. This can have a devastating impact on your credit score and your finances.
