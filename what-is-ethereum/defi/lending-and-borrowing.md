# ðŸ”„ Lending & borrowing

Lending and borrowing in Defi refers to the act of lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. This is done through protocols and platforms that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized party.

One of the main benefits of lending and borrowing is that it allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies. This is because when you lend your cryptocurrencies, you are essentially giving someone else the opportunity to use them and earn interest on them.

Another benefit of lending and borrowing in Defi is that it allows users to take out loans in cryptocurrencies. This can be useful for people who want to invest in cryptocurrencies but do not have the funds to do so. By taking out a loan, they can get the funds they need and pay back the loan with interest.

The main risk of lending and borrowing in Defi is that it is still a new and emerging technology. This means that there are still a lot of unknowns and risks associated with it. For example, there is the risk that a platform or protocol could be hacked and users could lose their funds. There is also the risk that a platform could suddenly become insolvent and users could lose their money.
