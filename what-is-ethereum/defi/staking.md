# Staking

Staking can mean various things in the crypto space. Generally, staking is the act of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. Essentially, it is a form of cryptocurrency investment. The stakeholder receives rewards for their contribution, which is typically in the form of new coins or tokens. Otherwise, it could also refer to participation in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system to put your tokens in to serve as a validator to the blockchain and receive rewards.
