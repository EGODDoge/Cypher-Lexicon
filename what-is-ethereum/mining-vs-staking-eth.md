# ‚õè Mining Vs Staking ETH

Mining is the process of verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and earning rewards for doing so. This is done by running special mining software on your computer which competes with other miners to be the first to verify a block of transactions. If you are the first to verify a block, you are rewarded with a certain amount of ETH.

Staking is the process of holding ETH in your wallet to help secure the network. When you stake ETH, you are essentially allowing the Ethereum network to use your ETH as collateral in case something goes wrong. If something does go wrong, your ETH is at risk of being confiscated by the network. However, if everything goes smoothly, you will earn a reward for helping to secure the network.
