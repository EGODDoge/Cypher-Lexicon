# ðŸ“” What are Smart Contracts

A programmable contract written in code that is stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically when the conditions of the contract are met. Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met, allowing two counterparties to set conditions of a transaction without needing to trust another third party for the execution. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.
