# ðŸ‘· POW / POS

Mining POS- Proof of Stake (POS) uses randomly selected miners to validate transactions. In order to do this, miners must put up a certain amount of money as a stake, which is used to determine how much power they have to verify transactions. The more money a miner puts up as a stake, the more likely they are to be chosen to validate a new block of transactions, and the more rewards they stand to earn.

Mining (POW)- Proof of Work (POW) uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The validation method involves difficult math problem to verify digital transactions. This problem is called a hashcash puzzle. In order to create a new hash, a miner must solve the puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to create the new block and receives a reward in the form of new coins.
