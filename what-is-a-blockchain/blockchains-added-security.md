# 🔐 Blockchains added Security

The records on a blockchain are secured through cryptography, with each network participant having their own private keys that are assigned to the transactions they make. This acts as a personal digital signature - so if a record is altered, the signature will become invalid and the peer network will be notified immediately. This early notification is crucial in preventing further damage.
